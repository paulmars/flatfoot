= Flatfoot

a flatfile based ORM

Uses flat files and YAML serialization to store data. Great for blogs and other simple things.

fn is the shorthand for 'filename' which is the primary key.

currently uses a random_string of X characters for uniqueness, this is easily overidable by changeing "generate_fn" method.


class User < Flatfoot

  has_many :photos
  has_many :posts

  attributes :name, :hashed_password, :salt, :email

end

class Post < Flatfoot

  belongs_to :user
  attributes :title, :body

end

u = User.create(:name => "paul")
p = Post.create(:user => u)
